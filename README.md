# OBSTACLE-AVOIDANCE-ROBOT

## OVERVIEW

The Obstacle Avoidance Robot is an autonomous robotic system designed to navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles using sensors and programmed intelligence. This robot can be used for various applications, including autonomous navigation, surveillance, and educational projects.

### Features
* Ultrasonic sensor-based obstacle detection
* Automatic path correction
* Real-time environment scanning
* Compact and efficient design

### Components 
* Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
* Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
* Motor Driver Module (L298N)
* DC Motors with Wheels
* Power Supply (Battery pack)
* Chassis (Custom-built or ready-made)

## WORKING PRINCIPLE
The robot utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in its path. When an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the microcontroller processes the sensor data and directs the motors to change the robotâ€™s direction to avoid a collision. The system continuously scans the environment and adapts its movement accordingly.

## How to Use

**1. AssemblY**
* Connect the ultrasonic sensors to the microcontroller.
* Attach the motor driver module and connect it to the motors.
* Mount all components securely onto the chassis.
* Ensure the battery is properly connected.


**2. Programming**
* Upload the obstacle avoidance code to the microcontroller using a USB cable.
* Adjust sensor sensitivity and motor speed if needed.

**3. Testing**
* Place the robot in an open area.
* Power it on and observe its movement.
* Make necessary adjustments for better obstacle detection and avoidance.
